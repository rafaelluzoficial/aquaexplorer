# NASA AquaExplorer Project

Welcome to the source of [AquaExplorer Project](https://aquaexplorer.space/).


The project comprises of 3 main stages:

Step 1: Data Collection and Analysis
This stage involves continuous data collection from NASA’s Grace and Grace-FO missions. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of historical data concerning groundwater, root zone, and surface water levels to discern patterns and variations over time, particularly those correlated with shifts in water resources.

Step 2: Trend Assessment
In this phase, we assess soil trends and conditions. This assessment holds significance across various sectors, as it furnishes essential insights into soil permeability and water retention characteristics. These insights serve as valuable guidance for the management of water resources, aiding in their adaptation to the ever-changing climate conditions.

Step 3: Informed Decision-Making
The metrics we’ve presented seek to provide value to water resource managers. They serve as powerful tools for making informed decisions regarding water allocation, irrigation practices, and crop management. By optimizing water utilization, maximizing crop yields, and implementing conservation measures, these metrics empower managers to respond effectively to droughts and extreme weather events.
